# Find

This addon is a functional copy of the "Find" plugin for Windower. It searches your bags for items with names containing a given string (case-insensitive) and prints the search results in your chat log.

### Example

`//find Bullet`

`//find Foo` and `//find foo` will yield the same result, because finding an item works on a case-insensitive basis.
