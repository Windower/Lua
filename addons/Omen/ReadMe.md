**Description:**  
Omen is an addon that creates a custom window that tracks the current floor's Primary and Secondary objectives.
The addon also tracks time left for secondary objs and their current in-progress status.
Text colour, font size, background alpha and window position can be configured inside the config.xml file that gets created the first time you run the addon, alternatively the window can be dragged and dropped wherever on the screen.

**Config file:**  
Add a `<yourcharname></yourcharname>` section into the config.xml and report the fields you wish to set to different values from the default ones.
Colours are expressed in R, G, B values and they range from 0 to 255
