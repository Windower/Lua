Job Change AddOn.

Allows command line job change as long as you're within 6 yalms of a Job Change NPC. 

Usage:
//jc main job    -- Change main to 'job'
//jc sub job     -- Change subjob to 'job'
//jc reset   --  Basically resets your subjob off target and back on to reset JA's

If you are already the slot and job you want (IE you're already WAR and want to change MAIN to war) we'll temp-change to another job and change back to WAR.

If your sub or main conflicts with the target job change (IE: You're main WAR and want to change to sub WAR) we'll temp-change MAIN to another job (random starter), then change sub to WAR.
