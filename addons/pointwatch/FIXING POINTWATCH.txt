Updating Message IDs: A guide

    Pointwatch relies on zone-based message IDs for some of its features.
These IDs change on a regular basis. Fortunately, their positions relative
to one another rarely change, which means that most of the time you only
have to change one number and the entire zone will work again.

I have written this guide to explain how to change those numbers in the
hopes that members of the community will maintain pointwatch's message-
dependent features.

Method 1 - POLUtils
1) Download POLUtils (if you don't already have it) from the google code site
2) Install it and run it
3) Click "FFXI Data Browser"
4) Go to the "Dialog Tables" menu and select the zone you are interested in
5) Wait for it to load, then export the entire table as xml
6) Open the xml file up in a text editor, like Notepad or Notepad++.
7) Control-F for the key phrase.
8) The associated message ID is the offset value for that zone.

Method 2 - message_printing
1) Load Pointwatch (//lua l pointwatch)
2) Enable message printing (//pw message_printing)
3) Generate the key message (for instance, by resting in Abyssea)
4) This will print message IDs to your windower console. They appear in the
    order they were generated. Select the one that you want (for instance,
    the second one when you rest in Abyssea).
5) That value is your offset.
6) Disable message printing (//pw message_printing)

Both methods:
* Open message_ids.lua
* Find the zone and replace the zone.offset value with the correct value.
* Submit your file to Github, so that everyone can have a working copy!
