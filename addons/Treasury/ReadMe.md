# Treasury

An addon that manages the treasure pool for you and keeps your inventory clean of unwanted items. It does three things:
1. It lots/passes on items in the treasure pool based on per-character rules as defined in the settings file
2. It automatically stacks items in your inventory after it changes, if enabled
3. If automatically drops unwanted items from your inventory, if enabled

### Commands

Note:
All commands can be shortened to `//tr`. `lot` and `pass` can be shortened to `l` and `p` respectively. `add` and `remove` can be shortened to `a` or `+` and `r` or `-` respectively.

`//treasuy lot|pass|drop add|remove [global] <name>`

This will add to or remove from the lot list, pass list or drop list all items matching `name`. `name` can contain standard Windower wildcards (`*`, `?`, `|`). It will add those for the current character only, unless `global` is specified, in which case it will add it for all characters.

There are a few special key words for `name`:
* `crystals` matches all crystal items (excluding HQ synthing crystals)
* `geodes` matches all geode items (NQ)
* `avatarites` matches all geode items (HQ)
* `currency` matches all Dynamis currency (all three tiers of all three kinds)
* `seals` matches the standard seals found in the field (BS, KS, KC, HKC, SKC)
* `pool` matches your current treasure pool

'//treasury lot|pass|drop clear|list`

This will either clear the specified list (for the current character only) or list all items on the specified list.

`//treasury lotall|passall`

Lots/passes on all items currently in the pool

`//treasury clearall`

Clears all character-specific settings (it will keep global settings)

`//treasury delay <value>`

Sets the delay that should pass before lotting/passing/dropping items, in seconds. It will lot/pass/drop items in a random time interval between half the value specified and the full value. I.e. if you specify 5 seconds it will lot/pass/drop between 2.5 seconds and 5 seconds randomly.

`//treasury <autodrop|citydrop|autostack|verbose> [on|off]`

Sets the provided setting to true or false. If neither is provided, it toggles the current setting.

`//treasury save`

Saves the current character's settings for all characters.
