This addon redirects the nm's weaknesses (VW or Abyssea) to the "tell" stream so that they can be held in the chat log using the chat filters' hold function (Config > Chat Filters > "Enter" on "Tell" until you get the green "hold" icon).
Moreover, the important informations are highlighted and a number is added to quickly understand the vulnerability level (1, 3, 5).
