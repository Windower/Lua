Addon is to allow you to ignore people in ffochat.

Abbreviation: //cblock

The following commands are available:

1. //cblock delete &lt;name&gt;
	--Unignores &lt;name&gt; so you can see what they're saying again
2. //cblock ignore &lt;name&gt;
	--Ignores &lt;name&gt; adds then to your blacklist.txt so you don't see anything from them until you either remove them or delete blacklist.txt.
