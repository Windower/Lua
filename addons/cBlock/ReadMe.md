Addon is to allow you to ignore people in ffochat.

Abbreviation: //cblock

The following commands are available:

1. //cblock delete <name>
	--Unignores <name> so you can see what they're saying again
2. //cblock ignore <name>
	--Ignores <name> adds then to your blacklist.txt so you don't see anything from them until you either remove them or delete blacklist.txt.
