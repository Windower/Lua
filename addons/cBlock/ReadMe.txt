CBlock v 1.0
The entire purpose of this addon is to allow you to ignore people in ffochat.

The following commands are available:

cblock delete <name>
	--Unignores <name> so you can see what they're saying again
cblock ignore <name>
	--Ignores <name> adds then to your blacklist.txt so you don't see anything from them
	--until you either remove them or delete blacklist.txt.
