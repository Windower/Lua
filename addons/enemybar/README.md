# enemybar

This is an addon for Windower4 for FFXI. It creates a big health bar for the target to make it easy to see.

UPDATE: 1.1
Updates;
- unified healbar creation and management logic
Added several things:
- mob action (spell/ws) and attention tracking
- aggro'd mobs can now be displayed as a stack of health bars + their action and attention
- display for target/subtarget/aggro'd mobs' distance.
- indicator on aggro'd mobs' health bars for which is targeted.
