***********************************************************************
I stopped playing FFXI (in February 2015) so I may not be able to help
with bugs but I'll try... So long as you can give me more information
then "it doesn't work"

This addon requires the Timers plugin to display your "recast" timer for
digging. It will also display statistics about your dig accuracy,
fatigue and remaining greens after each dig. The fatigue tracking will
also work properly with the Blue Racing Silks bonus.

The available commands are:
    digger rank <crafting rank>
        Sets your digging rank. Accepts rank name (like "Artisan") or
        area delay (like "A25").
    digger stats [clear]
        Displays or clears digging accuracy statistics.
