MacroPolo is a macro management addon that enables the use of a 'back' command thus allowing shared sets across different macro books.

Usage within macros: 
/macropolo [current_book]-[current_set] [destination_book] [destination_set]
/console macropolo [current_book]-[current_set] [destination_book] [destination_set]

Example: '/macropolo 3-1 1-5': records the current macro position, as Book 3 Set 1 and then sends the user to Book 1, Set 5.

You may then use either of these commands in a macro to return to the previous book and set.
/macropolo back
/console macropolo back
