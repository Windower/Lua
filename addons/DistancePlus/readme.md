# DistancePlus

Enhances the functionality of the Distance AddOn.  You will want to unload Distance before loading DistancePlus.

Note:  Most of this is based on my play style and what matters to me for distances.  Not all jobs are well accomodated, but many are.

Features:
* Views distance to the nearest 100th' vs 10th yalm.
* Adds distance between Master and Pet.  For BST if you are within the yalm requirement it will turn Green to do a Ready Move or Reward.
* Can type //dp ja   - to show a list of Job Abilities and they will turn green/white depending on range to use.  (Not all JA's represented, would be nice to have community submit.)
* Can type //dp height   - This will show a height differential between you and target mob.   Red if you are in danger of AOE abilities, and Green if you are safe.   This is very helpful for Geas Fete fights where a height advantage is mandatory for survival.
* Mage jobs:
//dp Magic   will set green/white depending on casting range.
* Ranged Jobs:
//dp Gun | Bow | Xbow  will automatically color coordinate distance addon for optimal shooting range.
     White: Can not shoot
	 Yellow: Can shoot target but no attack gain
	 Green:  Shoots squarely (Good)
	 Blue: True Shot  (optimal range)
