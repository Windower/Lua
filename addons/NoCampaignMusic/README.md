# FFXI - No Campaign Music

Prevents all campaign battle music from playing in Final Fantasy XI, so you can listen to that sweet music that is normally obnoxiously interrupted.

## Load

```
//lua load ncm
```

## Activate/deactivate

```
//ncm on
```

```
//ncm off
```

## Campaign notifications

If you want to know when campaign is happening, you can toggle notifications:

```
//ncm notify
```

## Note

When campaign music is prevented from playing (whether it's as you zone in, or campaign starts in the zone) a message will log to the chatlog stating "Prevented campaign music." This not only confirms the addon is working, but shows you there's a campaign active should you want to take part.
