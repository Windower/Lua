# Emotes
Expands upon the games built-in emotes.

- Uses "single slash" commands just like the built-in emotes so they feel more natural to use.  
- Can tell the difference between targeting nothing/yourself, another player, a monster, an npc, and an object.  
- You can change your preferred pronoun any time with a command.


### Commands
All commands must be prefixed with either `//emotes` or `//em` (ex: `//em pro n`)
- help- displays the list of commands in-game.
- list - list the current emotes.
- pronoun/pro - display the current pronouns used.
  - builtin/b - change the current pronouns to use the games built-in pronouns for your character.
  - male/m - change the current pronouns to male.
  - female/f - change the current pronouns to female.
  - nonbinary/n - change the current pronouns to non-binary.
  - Append `all` to the above to change the pronoun for all characters. (ex: `//em pronoun builtin all` will set every character to use the games built-in pronouns)
