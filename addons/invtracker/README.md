# invtracker
This addon displays a grid detailing empty and filled inventory slots, similar to the FFXIV Inventory Grid HUD widget.

## How to edit the settings
1. Login to your character in FFXI
2. Edit the addon settings file: **_Windower4\addons\invtracker\data\settings.xml_**
3. Save the file
4. Press Insert in FFXI to access the windower console
5. Type ``` lua r invtracker ``` to reload the addon
6. Press Insert in FFXI again to close the windower console

## Issues:
1. You may need to log out from you character and enter again in order to have the addon display properly if loaded manually.
2. There is no way to get the inventory sort order, so all items in the grid will be ordered by status and item count.
